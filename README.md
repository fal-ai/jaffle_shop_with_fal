# jaffle_shop_with_fal

It is year 2 for our [jaffle shop](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop) and the shop owner started collecting advanced attributes about the [orders](https://github.com/fal-ai/jaffle_shop_with_fal/blob/main/seeds/raw_order_attributes.csv).

We are tasked to understand what kind of jaffles we make the most money from.

So we decided to run a [clustering algorithm](https://github.com/fal-ai/jaffle_shop_with_fal/blob/main/clustering.py) to separate the orders into 3 different clusters and then to calculate all the [revenue for each cluster](https://github.com/fal-ai/jaffle_shop_with_fal/blob/main/models/cluster_stats.sql). Once our clustering algorithm is done, we want to send a notification to a Slack channel notifying our team that the results are ready for viewing.

The [fal](https://github.com/fal-ai/fal) + [dbt-fal](https://github.com/fal-ai/fal/tree/main/adapter) combination is the perfect tool for the task at hand:

- `dbt-fal` adapter lets us iterate on and ship our clustering algorithm **right within our dbt project**. This Python model works with any data warehouse, including ones without dbt Python support such as Postgres and Redshift. For Bigquery, it makes it easier to run Python models without having to stand up a Dataproc cluster.

- `fal flow` CLI command lets us send a Slack notification, via a Python post-hook. We could also execute any arbitrary Python here, for example to push data to external services.

With this combo, you won't have to leave your dbt project and still add more capabilities to your stack.

### Installing Instructions:

1. Install `fal` and `dbt-fal`

```
$ pip install fal dbt-fal[duckdb]
# Add your favorite adapter here
```

2. Install the data science libraries to run the clustering script.

```
$ pip install kmodes convertdate pystan prophet plotly kaleido
```

3. Run dbt seed

```
$ dbt seed
```

### Running Instructions:

1. Run `dbt run`

```bash
$ dbt run
## Runs the SQL models on the datawarehouse and Python models locally with fal
```

2. Run `fal flow run` to execute the full graph including Python scripts. You can use the dbt [graph selectors](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/graph-operators) and [much more](https://docs.fal.ai/). With `fal flow run`, you will not have to run `dbt run` since fal handles the full execution.

```bash
$ fal flow run
## Runs dbt run and the associated scripts, in this case a Slack notification is triggered
```
